# UI Test Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The UI test project was failing to build with the error:
```
Empty ResolveFrameworkReference.RuntimePackPath while trying to read runtime components manifest. ResolvedFrameworkReference available: { Microsoft.NETCore.App, RuntimePackPath:  }
```

This is a known issue with .NET 8 and macOS Catalyst targets when runtime framework references are not properly configured.

## Solution
1. **Changed Target Framework**: Changed from `net8.0-maccatalyst` to `net8.0` since UI tests run on the host system, not in the macOS Catalyst runtime.

2. **Removed Project Reference**: Removed the direct project reference to `PKHeX.MAUI.csproj` since UI tests interact with the app externally through automation APIs, not internal references.

3. **Updated Configuration**: Added proper build configuration settings for the test project.

4. **Updated Package Version**: Updated `SixLabors.ImageSharp` from 3.1.7 to 3.1.8 to address security vulnerabilities.

## Files Modified
- `PKHeX.MAUI.UITests/PKHeX.MAUI.UITests.csproj`

## Build Status
✅ **FIXED** - The UI test project now builds successfully
✅ The entire solution builds without critical errors
⚠️ Only minor warnings remain (mostly platform-specific image processing warnings)

## Running Tests
The UI tests can now be built with:
```bash
dotnet build PKHeX.MAUI.UITests/PKHeX.MAUI.UITests.csproj
```

The tests are designed to run on macOS CI runners where Appium drivers and macOS automation APIs are available. For local testing, ensure the MAUI app is built and running before executing the UI tests.

## Architecture
UI tests now follow the correct pattern:
- Test project targets `net8.0` (runs on host system)
- Tests launch and interact with the separately built MAUI app
- Uses Appium WebDriver for macOS automation
- No direct code dependencies on the MAUI project
