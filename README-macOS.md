   ```
3. Drag `PKHeX.MAUI.app` to your `/Applications` folder
4. Launch from Launchpad or Finder like any other Mac app

## Usage

1. **Launch PKHeX** using one of the methods above
2. **Load a Save File**:

   - Right-click the app and select "Open"
   - Click "Open" in the dialog
   - Or run: `sudo xattr -cr PKHeX.MAUI.app`

2. **Build Errors**:
   - Ensure you have .NET 8.0 SDK installed
   - Make sure MAUI workload is installed: `sudo dotnet workload install maui`
   - Verify Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

3. **App Won't Launch**:
   - Try running from Terminal: `dotnet run` in the PKHeX.MAUI folder
   - Check Console.app for error messages

### Performance Notes

- Some image processing functions show warnings (System.Drawing.Common limitations on macOS)
- These warnings don't affect core functionality
- Sprite rendering may be limited compared to Windows version
