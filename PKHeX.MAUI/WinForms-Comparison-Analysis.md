# PKHeX MAUI vs WinForms Controls Analysis

## Current State Analysis

After examining the official PKHeX WinForms implementation, our MAUI version is missing several critical components and architectural patterns that are essential for a complete Pokemon editor.

## Missing Critical Components

### 1. **Comprehensive PKM Editor Architecture**

**WinForms Has:**
- `PKMEditor.cs` (2217 lines) - Master editor with full Pokemon editing capabilities
- `IMainEditor` interface for standardized editing functionality
- Generation-specific editors (`EditPK1.cs` through `EditPK9.cs`)
- Specialized components for each Pokemon format

**Our MAUI Implementation:**
- ❌ Simple `PokemonEditorPage` with basic functionality only
- ❌ Missing generation-specific handling
- ❌ No comprehensive validation system integration
- ❌ Missing advanced editing features

### 2. **Advanced Stat Management**

**WinForms Has:**
- `StatEditor.cs` (753 lines) - Comprehensive IV/EV/stat management
- Hyper Training support
- Awakening Values (for LGPE)
- Generation Values (for GO integration)
- Real-time stat calculation with color coding
- Advanced shortcuts (Ctrl+Click for max IVs, etc.)

**Our MAUI Implementation:**
- ❌ Basic sliders for IVs only
- ❌ Missing EV management
- ❌ No Hyper Training support
- ❌ Missing advanced stat features

### 3. **Move Management System**

**WinForms Has:**
- `MoveChoice.cs` - Advanced move selection with PP management
- Move legality validation with visual indicators
- Type sprite display
- PP Up management
- Context-aware move filtering

**Our MAUI Implementation:**
- ❌ Basic move pickers only
- ❌ No PP management
- ❌ Missing move legality validation
- ❌ No type information display

### 4. **Advanced Box Management**

**WinForms Has:**
- `BoxEditor.cs` (260 lines) - Full drag-drop functionality
- `SlotChangeManager.cs` - Advanced slot management
- `BoxMenuStrip.cs` - Context menus for box operations
- Visual indicators for Pokemon status
- Batch operations support

**Our MAUI Implementation:**
- ❌ Basic grid with click-to-edit only
- ❌ No drag-drop functionality
- ❌ Missing context menus
- ❌ Limited batch operations

### 5. **SAV Editor Infrastructure**

**WinForms Has:**
- `SAVEditor.cs` (1288 lines) - Comprehensive save file management
- `PartyEditor.cs` - Party Pokemon management
- Integration with box editor and PKM editor
- Save file validation and integrity checking

**Our MAUI Implementation:**
- ❌ No dedicated SAV editor
- ❌ Missing party management
- ❌ Limited save file operations

### 6. **Specialized Components Missing**

**WinForms Has:**
- `TrainerID.cs` - Advanced trainer ID management (as shown in your file)
- `BallBrowser.cs` - Ball selection interface
- `ContestStat.cs` - Contest stat management
- `FormArgument.cs` - Form-specific data handling
- `GenderToggle.cs` - Gender selection
- `CatchRate.cs` - Catch rate management
- `ShinyLeaf.cs` - HGSS Shiny Leaf management
- `SizeCP.cs` - Size and CP for GO/LGPE

**Our MAUI Implementation:**
- ❌ Missing all specialized components
- ❌ No advanced Pokemon property management

## Architectural Differences

### WinForms Architecture
```
PKMEditor (Master Controller)
├── StatEditor (IV/EV/Stats)
├── MoveChoice × 4 (Moves + Relearn)
├── TrainerID (Trainer Management)
├── Various Specialized Controls
└── Generation-Specific Handlers

SAVEditor (Save Management)
├── BoxEditor (Box Management)
├── PartyEditor (Party Management)
├── SlotChangeManager (Slot Operations)
└── Context Menus & Batch Operations
```

### Our MAUI Architecture
```
MainPage
├── PokemonBoxPage (Basic Grid)
├── PokemonEditorPage (Simple Editor)
├── PokemonDatabasePage (Species Browser)
└── SaveValidationPage (Validation)
```

## Critical Improvements Needed

### 1. **Enhanced PKM Editor**
We need to restructure `PokemonEditorPage` to include:
- Comprehensive stat management (IV/EV/Hyper Training)
- Advanced move management with PP and legality
- Generation-specific handling
- Specialized property editors

### 2. **Advanced Box Editor**
Enhance `PokemonBoxPage` with:
- Drag-drop functionality
- Context menus for batch operations
- Visual status indicators
- Multi-select capabilities

### 3. **Comprehensive SAV Editor**
Create a dedicated save editor with:
- Party management
- Save file integrity checking
- Advanced batch operations
- Integration with other editors

### 4. **Specialized Components**
Add missing specialized editors:
- Advanced trainer ID management
- Ball selection interface
- Contest stats (for applicable generations)
- Form-specific data handling

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Editor Enhancement
1. **Enhance PokemonEditorPage** with comprehensive stat management
2. **Add EV/IV advanced controls** with proper validation
3. **Implement move management** with PP and type display
4. **Add generation-specific handling**

### Phase 2: Advanced Box Management
1. **Implement drag-drop** in PokemonBoxPage
2. **Add context menus** for batch operations
3. **Create visual indicators** for Pokemon status
4. **Multi-select functionality**

### Phase 3: Specialized Components
1. **TrainerID management** similar to WinForms version
2. **Ball browser** for proper ball selection
3. **Contest stats** for applicable generations
4. **Form-specific editors**

### Phase 4: SAV Editor
1. **Dedicated save editor** interface
2. **Party management** system
3. **Save integrity** checking
4. **Advanced batch operations**

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Analyze TrainerID.cs** structure and implement MAUI equivalent
2. **Study StatEditor.cs** for comprehensive stat management
3. **Examine MoveChoice.cs** for proper move handling
4. **Review BoxEditor.cs** for advanced box operations

The current MAUI implementation is functionally basic compared to the comprehensive WinForms version. While it provides basic Pokemon editing, it lacks the depth and sophistication needed for advanced Pokemon management that users expect from PKHeX.
